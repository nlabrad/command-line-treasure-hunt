``cd`` to change directories

``ls`` to list files in a directory

``pwd`` to find out where you currently are

``cat`` to print a file to the terminal

Ready to get started? Open a terminal and let's go!

First, clone this repository and change directories into it:

```
git clone https://github.com/nlabrad/command-line-treasure-hunt.git
cd command-line-treasure-hunt
```

Now let's go exploring. Go into the garden directory: ``cd garden``. Once you get there, ``ls`` to see what's around, and ``cat README.md`` to see your next set of instructions.


If you're seeing this in the terminal:
You might recognize this file. It's the same one you saw on Github. Github displays any README.md file it finds on a directory to show it's contents on the repository website.


Good luck!
