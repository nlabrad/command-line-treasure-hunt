# Front room

A cozy front room, but no treasure. The tracks head into the kitchen. Let's go up to the house/ directory and into the kitchen/ instead!

Don't forget you can type ``pwd`` to figure out where you are right now!

```
hint:
.. represents "the directory that contains the one I'm in" 
and you can pass it to cd as an argument. Could be useful to go back to the "house"
remember:
cd changes directories (rooms)
ls lists the contents
and cat shows you the content of a file.

if you need more details about the commands, man {command} displays the manual.
```
